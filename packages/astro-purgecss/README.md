[Purgecss][purgecss] helps you remove unused CSS rules from your final astro bundle.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install

the `astro add` command-line tool automates the installation for you. Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window. (If you aren’t sure which package manager you’re using, run the first command.) Then, follow the prompts, and type “y” in the terminal (meaning “yes”) for each one.

```bash
# Using NPM
npx astro add astro-purgecss
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add astro-purgecss
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add astro-purgecss
```

### Manual Install

First, install the `astro-purgecss` package using your package manager. (If you aren’t sure which package manager you’re using, run the first command.)

```bash
# Using NPM
npm install astro-purgecss
# Using Yarn
yarn add astro-purgecss
# Using PNPM
pnpm install astro-purgecss
```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file using the integrations property:

```js
import purgecss from 'astro-purgecss';

export default {
  // ...
  integrations: [purgecss()]
};
```

> **Note**
>
> To make sure this integration works properly, it's recommended to put `purgecss()`
> as the last element in the `integrations` array.

## 🥑 Usage

When you install this integration, things will be auto-wired for you. and all your generated css files should be purged from unused classes automagically.

## 📖 Configuration

[PurgeCSS][purgecss] has a list of options that allow you to customize its behavior. And this Astro integration allow you to pass those options easily in your `astro.config.mjs` file:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    purgecss({
      fontFace: true,
      keyframes: true,
      safelist: ['random', 'yep', 'button', /^nav-/],
      blocklist: ['usedClass', /^nav-/]
    })
  ]
});
```

### Available Options

Here is a list of options, that are allowed to be passed in the config:

```ts
export type PurgeCSSOptions = {
  fontFace?: boolean; // removes any unused @font-face if set to true
  keyframes?: boolean; // removes unused keyframes by setting if set to true
  rejected?: boolean; // scan through the removed list to see if there's anything wrong
  rejectedCss?: boolean; // keeps the discarded CSS
  variables?: boolean; // removes any unused CSS variables if set to true
  safelist?: UserDefinedSafelist; // indicates which selectors are safe to leave in the final CSS
  blocklist?: StringRegExpArray; // blocks the CSS selectors from appearing in the final output CSS
};
```

To learn more about the available options, please refer to [PurgeCSS][purgecss-options] official docs.

We have also setup an example repository available here: [example-purgecss](../../apps/example-purgecss)

### Caveats

- Certain options (ex: `css`, `content`), are not allowed to be passed in your `astro.config.mjs` config file, to not interfere with the internals of this integration.

- If you are using `tailwind.css`, please read about purge limitations in this guide [writing-purgeable-html](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html)
